# Usecases

- More unified experience across frontend projects
- Accessibility warnings
- Not sure if this would work, but it would be great to see if we could use eslint to alert users that they're using a legacy component that can be replaced with a design-system component. (e.g "'@single-js/common/components/button' is deprecated and should be replaced with '@single-js/design-system/button'").

- I'm not experienced with eslint but we should experiment and see how customisation and standardization can be of use to us here
