# Usecases

- More unified experience across frontend projects
- It would be great to see if we could use eslint to alert users that they're using a legacy component that can be replaced with a design-system component. (e.g "'@single-js/common/components/button' is deprecated and should be replaced with '@sui/react-button'"). Although, we could potentially do this more easily by adding TypeScript code to the single-js component itself.

- I'm not experienced with eslint but we should experiment and see how customisation and standardization can be of use to us here
